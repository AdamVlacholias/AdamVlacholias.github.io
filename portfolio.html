<h2><u>A Poem by Any Other Name</u></h2>
<pre>
Happy, glad,
Quite overjoyed.
Elated, ecstatic,
Immune from the tragic.
Merry, cheerful, fully content,
Living a life without need to lament,

I can ramble verbosely with words upon words,
With thesaurus in hand just to stray from the herds.
Alternatively; eloquence.

The difference you see’s mostly hidden from me.
I can sit by the sea and then dig with my hands
But I can’t tell a good from a great grain of sand

That’s how I feel about words on this page
You define what you read from your race and your age.
From the path that you’ve traveled, be it narrow or wide,
Can’t predict how you feel lest your shoes I’m inside.
And even then, I don’t know what you’d think do or say
So how can I know if you'll feel the same way?

Will you read out these words with my same rigid meter,
Or will it come out so bad you’d mistake me for Peter?
Will you catch that dumb reference, and think that it’s shit?
When I sit with these questions, I’m tempted to quit.
When I write for myself it’s almost never this hard,
I’ll express how I feel, go from spock to picard

And I know what I meant cause I wrote it for me
And I don’t mind the fact that I’ve rhymed me and see
Earlier on the page,
Because that’s what I chose
But my flows I mix up,
When the target is you.
Since you’ll half empty cup me,
And I’ve got to impress.
Show finesse with my flow
So you’ll think I’m the best.

I’ve a need for approval
That both drives and consumes me
And without that approval
Almost nothing can move me

<h2><u>Sofa King</u></h2>
<pre>
Brown rippled fabric on a marshmallow base
A throne designed for the modern king
My loveseat pawned comfort and style for space
I'm heels over head, reclined feet over face

Sleek, classy, polite, and european
This lazy young man would make a fine butler

With all this appeal it needs not to be said,
That when given the choice between couch and a bed
I'll choose couch every time till the day that I'm wed

<h2><u>Lovey Dovey</u></h2>
<pre>
Love is like a dove,
Both drift distant in the sky
And when I've tried to look at love
The sun blinds my sheltered eyes

So one day while blinded,
and feeling quite down
I went to my shed hoping help could be found
At first I was saddened,
Just finding more strife
By a rope caught my eye,
As did one fine coarse knife

I spun rope round my fist, creating a noose
And hung it along the edge of my roof
Inside that rope I placed not neck or fist
But the tastiest, smelliest and freshest of fish
So I sat with ears open,
eyes glued to the ground
Hours passed, I looked up,
but no fish could be found
I thought I was mad till I looked to the sky
And found that same dove with a fish flying high
It was then that I realised the problem was me
And my soft tender eyes that were too weak to see
Having these eyes causes nothing but pain
Muster all of my effort, with these eyes it's in vein
Just windows for sadness, that’re better kept shut
Even on cloudy days, by sun’s beams clouds get cut
Looking down at my knife, even it shined quite bright
So I gouged out my eyes, freed forever from light
